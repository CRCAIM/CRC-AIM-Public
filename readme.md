# CRC-AIM Public Repository

## Background

This is a public repository of information related to the Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma Incidence and Mortality (CRC-AIM) microsimulation model. CRC-AIM is a robust colorectal cancer (CRC) natural history and screening model that provides an accessible platform for collaborative simulation studies. This repository was created in the spirit of scientific engagement and transparency, and we will update it periodically as various components of CRC-AIM are added or improved.

We are currently finalizing a detailed manuscript that describes the natural history and screening components of this model. We will provide a link to that manuscript and its supplemental material upon publication.

## Collaborate

We are excited to collaborate with researchers and members the modeling community to address outstanding questions related to colorectal cancer screening. If you are interested in working with us, please email us at collaborate@crcaim.com.
