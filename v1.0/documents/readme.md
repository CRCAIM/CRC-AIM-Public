## Documents

Here is a list of documents explaining components of the CRC-AIM model develoment


* [Cause Specific Survival:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_CRC-Cause-Specific-Survival_FINAL.pdf) Supplemental tables and figures for cause-specific survival that describe the fitting and selection from among five different parametric linear regression models for colorectal cancers (CRCs) based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and location.
* [CRC Stage Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_CRC-Stage-Logistic-Regression_FINAL.pdf) Multinomial logistic regression to determine CRC stage based on size, with our corresponding query of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) dataset to better replicate our methodology.
* [Size Distribution for Clinical CRC:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_Size-Distribution-Clinical-CRC_FINAL.pdf) Discussions of how we generated the size distribution of clinically detectable CRC, with the corresponding SEER query.
* [CRC-AIM Recalibration:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_CRC-AIM-Recalibration_FINAL.pdf) Recalibration process for CRC-AIM, including presenting outputs from a prototype version of the model before the recalibration was conducted.
* [Differences Between CRC-AIM and CRCSPIN:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_Differences-Between-CRC-AIM-CRC-SPIN_FINAL.pdf) Description of the notable differences between CRC-AIM and CRC-SPIN.
* [Screening Outcomes Tables:](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/tree/master/documents/CRC-AIM_GitHub_Screening-Outcomes-Tables_FINAL.pdf) Using CRC-AIM, replicated screening outcomes supplemental tables from CISNET technical report for each screening modality.
