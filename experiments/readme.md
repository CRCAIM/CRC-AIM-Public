# CRC-AIM Experiments and Experimental Results

## Impact of Differential Adherence on the Comparative Effectiveness of Stool-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening

#### [Spectrum of Adherence Rates](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/blob/master/experiments/adherence_spectrum.md) - [Sensitivity Analysis](https://github.com/CRCAIM/CRC-AIM-Public/blob/master/experiments/adherence_spectrum_sensitivity.md)

## Additional Experiments
[Microsimulation Outcome Tables](excel/01_02_Microsimulation_Outcome_Tables.xlsx): CRC-AIM raw screening outcome tables per 1,000 persons free of diagnosed colorectal cancer at age 40 with no prior colorectal cancer screening.  4 million individuals of a 1975 birth cohort were simulated.  Period life-tables were used for all-cause mortality.

[COL Quant Qual Outcomes and Medical Decision Making](excel/01_02_COL_Quant_Qual_Outcomes_and_Medical_Decision_Making.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of colonoscopy screening outcomes (non-parametric regression), qualitative comparisons of colonoscopy efficient frontiers (percent agreement), and medical-decision making comparisons for screening window, benchmark colonoscopy, and recommended stool strategy

[CTC Quant Qual Outcomes](excel/01_02_CTC_Quant_QUAL_Outcomes.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of CTC screening outcomes (non-parametric regression) and qualitative comparisons of CTC efficient frontiers (percent agreement)

[FIT Quant Outcomes](excel/01_02_FIT_Quant_Outcomes.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of FIT screening outcomes (non-parametric regression)
gFOBT Quant Outcomes: Cross-model quantitative comparisons of gFOBT screening outcomes (non-parametric regression)

[gFOBT](excel/01_02_gFOBT_Quant_Outcomes.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of gFOBT screening outcomes (non-parametric regression)

[mtsDNA Quant Outcomes and AllStool Qual](excel/01_02_mtsDNA_Quant_Outcomes_and_AllStool_Qual.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of mtsDNA screening outcomes (non-parametric regression) and qualitative comparisons of Stool Test efficient frontiers (percent agreement)

[SIG Quant Qual Outcomes](excel/01_02_SIG_Quant_QUAL_Outcomes.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of Sigmoidoscopy screening outcomes (non-parametric regression) and qualitative comparisons of Sigmoidoscopy efficient frontiers (percent agreement)

[SIG_gFOBT Quant Outcomes](excel/01_02_SIG_gFOBT_Quant_Outcomes.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of Sigmoidoscopy+gFOBT screening outcomes (non-parametric regression)

[SIG_FIT Quant Outcomes and SIG_AllStool Qual](excel/01_02_SIG_FIT_Quant_Outcomes_and_SIG_AllStool_Qual.xlsx): Cross-model quantitative comparisons of Sigmoidoscopy+FIT screening outcomes (non-parametric regression) and qualitative comparisons of Sigmoidoscopy+Stool (FIT and gFOBT) efficient frontiers (percent agreement)
